# Who gets opportunities? Exploring minority coaching performance and outcomes vs. white coaches - how long does it take each to get promoted / fired? How many chances do they get after being let go?
# Give attention to minority coordinators who seem to deserve a shot at HC (be careful using subjective "Race" data for individuals)
# Are minorities equally under-represented among assistants, coordinators, and HCs?
# Are there certain HCs who seem to more readily give minorities promotions / coordinator opportunities?
