# Who gets opportunities? Exploring minority coaching performance and outcomes vs. white coaches - how long does it take each to get promoted / fired? How many chances do they get after being let go?
# Give attention to minority coordinators who seem to deserve a shot at HC (be careful using subjective "Race" data for individuals)
# Are minorities equally under-represented among assistants, coordinators, and HCs?
# Are there certain HCs who seem to more readily give minorities promotions / coordinator opportunities?

# Potential errors/ommissions in the analysis?
# 1. Small sample sizes (only 52 Black and 8 Other)
# 2. How many years were the coaches given to turn the program around? I think the "after" period varies. Do we need to adjust for this? For example, Hugh Freeze 1-year tenure at Arkansas State counts the same as his 5-year tenure at Ole Miss.
# 3. Could a handfull of coaches be skewing the data set? For example, Hugh Freeze is counted twice here as +Net_PPA for "The White Team," whereas Willie Taggart & Darrell Hazell are counted twice as -Net_PPA for "The Black Team."
# 4. "The Vandy Rule": First I was surprised to see James Franklin's Vandy tenure as only the 46th best Net_PPA. What he did there was really impressive. But then Derek Mason was penalized for following him. Derek Mason had the next highest win percentage of a Vandy HC since Gerry DiNardo in '91-'94 (7 total coaches since then). But he has the 25th worst coaching tenure on this list in terms of Net_PPA.
