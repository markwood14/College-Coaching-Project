# Who gets opportunities? Exploring minority coaching performance and outcomes vs. white coaches - how long does it take each to get promoted / fired? How many chances do they get after being let go?
# Give attention to minority coordinators who seem to deserve a shot at HC (be careful using subjective "Race" data for individuals)
# Are minorities equally under-represented among assistants, coordinators, and HCs?
# Are there certain HCs who seem to more readily give minorities promotions / coordinator opportunities?

# COMPONENTS, COMMUNITIES, & CLIQUES
# Community = a densely connected subset of vertices
# A connected component of a graph is a connected subset of vertices, none of which are connected to any other vertex in the graph. A disconnected graph is comprised of multiple connected components.
# Vertex partitioning occurs to cut/split connected graphs into disconnected subgroups. In a partition, all vertices must be in one and only 1 subgroup.
# Community Detection or Community Discovery = process of determining optimal vertex clusters or communities. (Unsupervised Learning)
# Louvain Algorithm is one type of Community Detection (most common and fastest) - maximizes modularity of the graph. Modularity measures how dense the connections are within subsets of vertices by comparing the density to that which would be expected from a random graph. The higher the modularity, the more connected the vertices are inside the subgroups compared to between the subgroups. 
# ^ basically like clustering but for graphs (with relationships).
# Clique = subset of vertices in an undirected subgraph whose induced subgraph is complete. (Our graph is directed)
# get weakly connected components:
graph_components <- components(graph, mode= "weak")
# how many components? 9
graph_components$no
# size of components? 1 huge one & 8 small ones
graph_components$csize
